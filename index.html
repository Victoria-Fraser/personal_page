        <h2>A message to my love</h2>
        <div class="message"> <p class="message">I created this page for you because I wanted to do something special
            for you, something you would love and appreciate. This is my virtual
            love letter to you.</p>
        <p class="message">This past year with you has been nothing short from amazing. I found
            a love with you that is so easy and fun. It's a new feeling to be so
            relaxed and happy with someone. I'm glad I found that in you. You've shown me love and kindness, you've made me laugh and roll my eyes at
            you more times than I (or you) can count, and I find that I keep loving
            you more and more.
        </p>
        <p class="message"> You're smart and you inspire me because there is nothing
        you won't try learn. I remember when I first met you (again) I was so in awe 
        of how much you could do, but now a year later I respect and admire you for it.
        I've seen where it's brought you and I'm so proud of you. I'm excited to see what
        this year has in store for you. I'm sure there'll be some easy and tough times, but
        I'm here to go through it all with you, and I've got your back always. 
        </p>
        <p class="message">You're funny and you're weird. You make me laugh even when I don't want to. You're also silly
            and cute sometimes. And what I really love is that I can be all those things with you too. You've
            allowed me to feel comfortable and at home when I'm around you. I really appreciate that. And I will
            follow you anywhere.
        </p>
        <p class="message">My heart is happy with you. I'm looking forward to many
            more adventures with you.
        </p>
        <p class="message" style="font-style: oblique;";>I love you with all my heart.</p>

        <h4>Two of my favourite quotes that make me think of you since we met.</h4>
        <p class="quotes">"And if I hadn't met you, I would have waited five hundred more years for you. A
            thousand years. And if this is all the time we were allowed to have.. the wait was
            worth it.
            <br>
            I believe that everything happened, exactly the way it had to, so I could find you."
            <br>
            - A Court of Wings and Ruin
        </p>
        <p class="quotes">
            "And isn't it just so pretty to think, all along there was some invisible string tying
            you to me."
            <br>

        </p>
         <p class="conclusion">I'm not really good at expressing my feelings in person so I hope
          this page always reminds you about how I feel and how much
       I truly love you. No matter what is going on in our lives, my love for
     you will never change.
